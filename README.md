# ML-SICK-InspectorP
My first project using SICK appSpace and SICK InspectorP product  
Created for learning purposes
This app can be used to control properties of a InspectorP camera device - SICK company -, and it was implemented the ML classification algorithm from device library.
In it, we can create labels and teach in three different ML techniques, although, it is just using one feature of each image as entry which is its histogram.
